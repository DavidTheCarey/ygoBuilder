## Next Steps ##
There's a few changes I would like to implement if I had more experience and time with this project. The sounds and animations
I used for this project were pretty rudimentary. I had to make some concessions for the start-game card flip animation and the sounds are less thematic and engaging than I had wanted. I also would have liked the actual art assets for the cards from the board game but I couldn't find them online (having them just flip to the color is a practical solution regardless). Having actual background art would be nice additionally.
