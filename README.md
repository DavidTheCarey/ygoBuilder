Make sure to sign in with your Google account so you can try making/editing Cards and creating comments on Cards you see posted!

## Next Steps ##
In the future, I would like to run through some of the CSS/HTML elements and format them in a cleaner way. I would also like to add a searchbar that allows you to seek out a desired card by it's name or other attributes. I didn't wanna go in over my head and try to allow the user to submit a picture for their cards since I have no idea how complicated that might be and formatting sounds like a nightmare. That being said, allowing users to submit their own images for the card art is the icebox feature I want in my web application the most.
